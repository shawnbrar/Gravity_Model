# Migration Analysis using Gravity Model: Linear, Poisson and Machine Learning Approaches

Spatial Interaction is a dynamic flow process from one place to another. It is general concept for any movement over space. It can be migration, journey from home to work and back, information and commodity flows, etc. To capture these spatial interactions, often times Gravity Models are used. These models theoretically suggest the interaction between two places decreases with the distance between them. In this paper we analyse the internal migration of US using linear, poisson and machine learning approaches.
